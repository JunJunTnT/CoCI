## Introduction

In this project, we implement Communication-aware Collective Intelligence(CoCI) in two different environment(`e.g.`, highway-env and multiagent-particle-env). By comparing our model with baseline models such as MADDPG, ACML, ATOC, etc, we prove that CoCI has better performance in uncertain communication channel(`e.g.`,network delay, packet loss). Code is available in the `highway` and `mpe` folders.

Binary-env is a small environment in which we test some conjectures about the efficiency of communication in MARL. Code is available in the `binary` folder.
